This is the directory in which you should place jar files needed by 
code within your custom indexing methods or your custom scripts.  
For instance if one of your methods looks up a value in a MySQL database, 
the JDBC jars for communicating with MySQL would be placed in this directory.  
Additionally if you have jars containing pre-compiled custom indexing mixins, 
they should be placed here as well.
