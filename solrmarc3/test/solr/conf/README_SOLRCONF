This is the directory in which you should place local modifications to the default 
configuration of solr.  Most commonly this will simply involve a modified 
solrconfig.xml and schema.xml, but it can also include a different solr.war file 
if you want or need one that is different from the Solr 1.4 release that is included
by default.   If you want to override the default single core configuration, consult 
the Generic VuFind example to see how to organize the files you need to place here.

Note: If you add any fields to your xxxx_index.properties  specification, you must 
ensure that there is either a <field> definition in the schema.xml file that matches 
each of your new fields, OR that there is a <dynamicField> that has a name pattern 
that matches that your new fields.
